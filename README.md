# Lox implementation in Java

This is my implementation of Lox in Java (jlox) following the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) book.

## Why use Java?

"A handy object representation and a really nice garbage collector are the main reasons weâ€™re writing
our first interpreter in Java."

## Usage

Compile
```
javac -d out src/*
```

Run
```
cd out
java com.craftinginterpreters.lox.Lox
```
